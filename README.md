## About Me

I‚Äôm a hands-on technologist with over 16 years of experience designing scalable systems that solve real-world problems. I believe architecture isn‚Äôt just about creating blueprints ‚Äî while great blueprints matter, they‚Äôre meaningless if they aren‚Äôt turned into reality. The real value lies in disciplined execution and thoughtful delivery.

My mindset is shaped by consistency ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs building systems, staying fit, or exploring winding roads on a long drive. I draw energy from clean eating, strength training, and road trips into the hills. These aren‚Äôt just routines ‚Äî they ground my thinking and fuel long-term focus.

Continuous learning is at the core of everything I do. Just like in fitness, growth in tech requires showing up daily, staying curious, and pushing through limits. I‚Äôm currently deepening my expertise in AI/ML through advanced coursework at IIT Kanpur, and I hold a Global MBA from Deakin Melbourne. I also mentor engineering teams on building practical, future-ready platforms that balance clarity with impact.

Let‚Äôs connect ‚Äî whether you want to talk systems, mindset, fitness, or your next scenic route.
